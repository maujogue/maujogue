### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Mathis
#### I strongly believe IT will be defining the world of the future. I aspire to build ***a part of it***.

I am currently studying at School 42 Lyon

For now, I'm tackling the discovery of all the technologies used in **full-stack** development, from **frontend/backend** languages to **servers**, **docker** and **version control** systems.
